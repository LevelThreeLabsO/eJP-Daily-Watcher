"""Fetching and parsing candidate items.

Three discovery methods, chosen per source in sources.yaml:

  rss          A native feed. Preferred: real URLs, real timestamps, real teasers.
  gnews        Site-scoped Google News search, for outlets with no usable feed —
               Bloomberg, Reuters, Zawya, WAM, Khaleej Times, Gulf News, MEED, Arab News.
               Roughly half The Circuit's own sourcing backbone falls in here.
  gnews_entity Entity-scoped Google News search, not restricted to one site: PIF,
               Mubadala, ADNOC, DP World and the rest of the roster, caught wherever
               they surface. This has no counterpart in the JI original.

Three things this module does that a naive port would not:

1. **Parses tolerantly, and reports parse failure as its own state.** Fitch, Argaam,
   ADX, Treasury, OPEC and the World Bank all serve real feeds that a strict XML parser
   rejects outright. Under `xml.etree` those come back as zero items — indistinguishable
   from a dead outlet. feedparser recovers them, and when it cannot, the caller hears
   "parse failure", not "nothing published".

2. **Verifies the publisher on every Google News item.** Google honours `site:` loosely
   and will return other domains. Unchecked, a foreign story arrives wearing the wrong
   outlet's label.

3. **Strips the appended publisher name before anything reads the headline.** Google
   News titles end in " - Publisher". The original hard-coded `" - Times of Israel"`
   while the feed actually sent `" - The Times of Israel"`, so every headline carried
   the outlet name twice for months. Here the suffix comes from the item's own source
   element, never from a hand-typed string.
