"""The Circuit newswire: one run.

Reads every source in sources.yaml, keeps what scores as Gulf-business relevant, drops
what has already been posted or is the same story someone else just filed, and posts one
bundled digest to Slack. Single-shot — one invocation per GitHub Actions tick.

    python3 poll.py                      real run (needs SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL)
    python3 poll.py --dry-run            print the digest, post nothing, touch no state
    python3 poll.py --dry-run --window-hours 24 --source agbi
    python3 poll.py --audit              every source: alive, fresh, parseable
    python3 poll.py --selftest           scoring recall + noise rate against fixtures
    python3 poll.py --score "headline"   score one headline and show which axes hit
    python3 poll.py --test-webhook       assert Slack answers `ok`
    python3 poll.py --status             print status.json

Gate order matters — an item rejected at gate 3 is never seen by gate 4:

    1 fetch      every source, threaded
    2 fresh      within that source's own window
    3 relevant   four-axis score >= the source's threshold
    4 unseen     not already posted, by URL hash and by headline hash
    5 unique     not the story another outlet just filed
    6 post       one bundled message, newest first, capped

Claim-before-send is the load-bearing rule: keys are written to state *before* the post
goes out, and rolled back if Slack refuses. Marking after sending means two overlapping
runs both read an empty store and both send the same digest; not rolling back means a
delivery outage eats the coverage instead of queueing it.

There is deliberately no concurrency lock. The workflow serializes runs, and in the
original two separate outages came from the guard rather than from concurrency — a real
lock wedged permanently when a run was killed while holding it, and its self-expiring
replacement then turned away two scheduled runs.
